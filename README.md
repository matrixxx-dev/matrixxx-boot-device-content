# matrixxx-boot-device-content
- This repository contains a composition of files that are necessary for
  the generation of a boot device for matrixxx (a D.I.Y linux live system)
- With the help of a script contained therein, a USB stick (or similar) can be
  made into a bootable medium
  (see [HowTo: Generate a bootable Flash Storage Device][readme: usage]
  ('en' and 'de')
- The parts of the operating system **have to be** added
  (generated by [github: matrixxx-os-build][matrixxx-os-build])
- The following parts **could be replaced** (but contained as a default):
  - the initramfs file (generated by
    [github: matrixxx-initrd-build][matrixxx-initrd-build])
  - the kernel and the corresponding kernel layer image
    (generated by [github: matrixxx-kernel-build][matrixxx-kernel-build])
